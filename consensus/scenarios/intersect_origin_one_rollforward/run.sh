# Orchestration for the intersect_origin_one_rollforward capture
# scenario.
#
# Lifecycle:
#   1. Build images (configurator + capture-sidecar).
#   2. `docker compose up -d` brings configurator + cardano-node up
#      detached. The configurator exits 0 after seeding; cardano-node
#      then forges. The sidecar is profile-gated and does NOT start
#      here — that prevents the configurator's clean exit from
#      tripping --abort-on-container-exit.
#   3. Poll cardano-node's healthcheck until it reports healthy.
#   4. `docker compose run --rm capture-sidecar` runs the capture to
#      completion. The sidecar bind-mounts the host output dir, so
#      the vector lands directly on disk — no docker cp round-trip.
#   5. Tear down.
#
# Invoked by ../../capture-scenario.sh intersect_origin_one_rollforward.
#
# Usage (via dispatcher):
#   capture-scenario.sh intersect_origin_one_rollforward [-out <path>] [--keep-up]
#
# Direct invocation is supported but `capture-scenario.sh` is the
# documented entry point.

  -out <path>     Destination path for the captured vector.

  --keep-up       Leave the docker-compose stack running on success.
  --skip-golden   No-op; accepted for bulk-wrapper compatibility.
