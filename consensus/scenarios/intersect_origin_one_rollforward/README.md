# intersect_origin_one_rollforward

Smallest possible consensus-capture scenario. Smoke-tests the whole
pipeline end to end with the absolute minimum protocol surface:

1. Capture-sidecar handshake against a single-pool cardano-node.
2. `find_intersect [origin]` → cardano-node replies `intersect_found`.
3. First `request_next` → cardano-node replies `roll_backward` to the
   origin intersect (standard chainsync semantics — the server
   confirms the agreed reference point before sending any new
   blocks).
4. Second `request_next` → cardano-node replies `roll_forward`
   carrying the first forged block.
5. Sidecar writes a `category=consensus` JSON vector and exits 0.

The vector has exactly one `peers` entry (`peer_id: 0`) whose `served`
array contains the captured roll_backward + roll_forward pair;
`expected_output.downstream_chainsync` mirrors that served trace
(single peer = no chain-selection ambiguity);
`expected_output.final_tip` matches the roll_forward's tip.

## How to run

From this directory (or via the dispatcher):

```bash
# Via the dispatcher — discovers this scenario by name.
../../capture-scenario.sh intersect_origin_one_rollforward -out /tmp/vector.json

# Or directly.
./run.sh -out /tmp/vector.json
```

`--keep-up` leaves the docker-compose stack running on success — useful
when poking the produced vector or the running cardano-node by hand.
