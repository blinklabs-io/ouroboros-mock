# Orchestration for the within_k_fork_v1 capture scenario.
#
# Lifecycle:
#   1. Build images (configurator + capture-sidecar + compose).
#   2. `docker compose up -d` brings configurator + cardano-peer-a +
#      cardano-peer-b + cardano-observation up detached. The configurator
#      runs three forge phases (shared prefix → peer A → peer B) and
#      exits 0; the three cardano-* services then start, with the
#      observation node connecting to both peers.
#   3. Poll healthchecks until all three cardano-* report healthy.
#   4. Brief settle delay so the observation node has stabilized on
#      its selected chain (Praos longest-chain across the two peers).
#   5. Run the capture-sidecar three times via `compose run --rm`,
#      once each against peer A, peer B, and observation. Outputs land
#      in the bind-mounted host output dir.
#   6. Run the composer once via `compose run --rm` to merge the three
#      single-peer captures into the multi-peer vector, with
#      -golden against the committed corpus for regression.
#   7. Move the composed vector to the user-supplied -out path (or the
#      scenario's default).
#   8. Tear down.
#
# Invoked by ../../capture-scenario.sh within_k_fork_v1.

  -out <path>     Destination path for the composed vector.
                  Defaults to the committed golden path:
                  ${GOLDEN_PATH}
  --keep-up       Leave the docker-compose stack running on success.
  --skip-golden   Skip the regression check against the committed
                  golden. Use when intentionally regenerating.
